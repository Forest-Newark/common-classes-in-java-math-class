In this exercise we will do the following:

* Clone a Git repository into your Projects folder
* Open an existing project in IntelliJ
* Create and invoke static methods
* Invoke static methods and properties on the Math class
* Run tests

## Instructions

1. Start by opening a new Terminal session.

2. Change into your Projects directory using the `cd` command:

	`cd ~/Projects`

3. Clone [this repository](https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/common-classes-in-java-math-class) using the `git clone` command:

	`git clone https://github.com/tiy-raleigh-java/common-classes-in-java-math-class`

	This should create a new directory at `~/Projects/common-classes-in-java-math-class`.

4. Open this project in IntelliJ

5. Find the `Main` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein.

6. Find the `Volume` class, open it, and follow the instructions in the comments therein.

7. When you're ready to run this code, select "Run all tests (All in common-classes-in-java-math-class)" in the drop down menu at the top of the screen and click the green Run button to the right.
